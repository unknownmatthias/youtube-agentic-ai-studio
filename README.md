## 🎬 Live Example — Built With This Tool

This repo powers **[Eldritch Lore](https://www.youtube.com/@EldritchLore)** — a real YouTube channel running entirely on this pipeline.

[![YouTube Subscribers](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCqDCtCHo22_6KtJ0rkDFG5g?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube&label=Eldritch%20Lore&color=FF0000)](https://www.youtube.com/@EldritchLore)

> "What if Napoleon had nukes? What if Earth was flat... and spinning?"
> Every video on this channel was researched, scripted, narrated, and uploaded using exactly this code.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 🚀 Installer (recommended — ~3 minutes)

```bash
# macOS / Linux — clones this fork, sets up a venv, asks for your API keys
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknownmatthias/youtube-agentic-ai-studio/main/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknownmatthias/youtube-agentic-ai-studio/main/install.py -OutFile install.py
python install.py
```

Then launch the dashboard:

```bash
./start-gui.command     # macOS   (double-clickable)
./start-gui.sh          # Linux
start-gui.bat           # Windows
# → Opens at http://localhost:7070
```

On macOS you can also just double-click **`install.command`**.
Full details, flags and troubleshooting → **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

### 🛠️ Manual setup

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/unknownmatthias/youtube-agentic-ai-studio.git
cd youtube-agentic-ai-studio

# 2. Install dependencies (a virtualenv is strongly recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Set your API keys (copy and edit .env.example)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY and PEXELS_API_KEY

# 4. Run the GUI
python gui.py
# → Opens at http://localhost:7070

# — OR — run the pipeline directly from the terminal
python pipeline.py
```

> **First run?** Read the full [Setup Guide](SETUP.md) — it takes about 10 minutes.
> The [installer](INSTALL.md) does all of the above for you.

## 🏗️ How It Works

The pipeline runs 6 sequential phases:

```
python pipeline.py  ──►  Research  ──►  Script  ──►  Narration
                                                          │
              YouTube ◄── Upload ◄── Review ◄── Video ◄──┘
```

| Phase | Agent | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · Research | `agents/researcher.py` | Gemini brainstorms trending topics for your niche and outputs a structured brief |
| 2 · Script | `agents/scriptwriter.py` | Expands the brief into a full narrated script with image queries per section |
| 3 · Narration | `video/narrator.py` | Edge-TTS converts the script to a cinematic MP3 voiceover |
| 4 · Images | `video/stock.py` | Downloads high-res stock photos from Pexels, topic-aware per section |
| 5 · Video | `video/creator.py` | Renders animated slides with Ken Burns, crossfades, captions, and music |
| 6 · Review | `review/app.py` | Spins up a local dashboard — you watch and approve before anything is published |
| 7 · Upload | `uploader/youtube.py` | Publishes to YouTube with full SEO metadata on your approval |

## 🤖 AI Model Fallback Chain

The system automatically tries models in order, rotating from your **Starting Model** preference:

```
gemini-2.5-flash  →  gemini-2.5-flash-lite  →  gemma-4-31b-it
       ↓
gemini-2.0-flash  →  gemini-2.0-flash-lite  →  gemma-3-27b-it
       ↓
gemini-1.5-flash-001  →  gemini-1.5-pro-001
```

If a model hits quota (429) or is overloaded (503), it automatically retries up to 3 times then advances to the next model — **so your pipeline never stops mid-run.**

Set your preferred starting model in the GUI under **Settings → AI Model**, or in `config.py`:

```python
GEMINI_MODEL = "gemini-2.0-flash"   # 1500 free req/day — recommended default
```

## 🔑 API Keys Required (All Free)

| Service | Key | Free Tier | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Gemini** | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | 1500 req/day | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| **Pexels** | `PEXELS_API_KEY` | 200 req/hour | [pexels.com/api](https://www.pexels.com/api/) |
| **Edge TTS** | *(none)* | Unlimited | Built-in |
| **YouTube API** | `client_secret.json` | Free | [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) |
| **ElevenLabs** | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Optional | [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io) |

> **Total cost: $0 per video.** All required services have free tiers that comfortably cover daily video production.

## 🎨 Customising Your Channel

Edit `config.py` to make the output yours:

```python
# 1. Describe your channel — the more specific, the better the topics
CHANNEL_DESCRIPTION = """
An educational channel covering the psychology of decision-making.
Target audience: adults 25-40 who enjoy Lex Fridman and Hidden Brain.
"""
CHANNEL_NAME = "Mind Mechanics"

# 2. Pick your voice
VOICE_ID = "en-GB-RyanNeural"   # British, deep, cinematic

# 3. Brand colours (RGB tuples)
COLORS = {
    "primary":   (99, 102, 241),   # your brand colour
    "highlight": (251, 191, 36),   # accent / titles
    ...
}

# 4. Video style
CROSSFADE_DURATION = 0.7   # image transition smoothness
OVERLAY_OPACITY    = 0.62  # how dark the image overlay is
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does this cost anything to run?</b></summary>

No. The entire stack uses free tiers:
- **Gemini** — 1500 req/day free on the 2.0-flash model
- **Pexels** — 200 req/hour free
- **Edge TTS** — completely free, no account needed
- **YouTube Data API** — free for uploads
- **Video rendering** — runs locally on your machine (CPU/GPU)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How long does one video take to generate?</b></summary>

On a mid-range machine (i7 + 16GB RAM):
- Research + Script: ~30 seconds
- Narration: ~10 seconds
- Image downloads: ~20 seconds
- Video render (10 min video): ~3–8 minutes depending on `RENDER_PRESET`
- Upload: ~2–5 minutes depending on internet speed

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use this without the YouTube upload?</b></summary>

Yes. The review step lets you click "Reject" to skip the upload — the rendered MP4 will still be saved in `output/`. You can also comment out the upload step in `pipeline.py` entirely.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why is moviepy pinned to 1.0.3?</b></summary>

MoviePy v2.0 removed the `moviepy.editor` module and changed the entire API. v1.0.3 is required. Similarly, NumPy must be `<2.0.0` because MoviePy's underlying C extensions were compiled against NumPy 1.x. **Do not upgrade either.**

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The video renders with tiny/ugly text</b></summary>

Your system is missing the fonts the renderer looks for. Install DejaVu fonts:
- **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install fonts-dejavu`
- **Mac:** `brew install --cask font-dejavu-sans-mono-nerd-font`  
- **Windows:** fonts are already present in `C:/Windows/Fonts/`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>YouTube upload fails with "access denied"</b></summary>

Delete `youtube_token.pickle` and re-run. This forces a fresh OAuth flow. Make sure your Google account is added as a **Test User** in Google Cloud Console → OAuth consent screen.

</details>
